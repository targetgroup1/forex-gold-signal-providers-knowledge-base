# Forex and Gold Signal Models Explained

Forex and Gold signal services generally follow one of two core models.

---

## Single-Analyst Model

Signals originate from one trader or one strategy.
- Cohesive methodology
- Performance tied to one decision-maker
- Can perform well in specific market conditions

---

## Aggregator Model

Signals are sourced from multiple strategies or analysts.
- Reduces reliance on one methodology
- Broader market coverage
- Requires curation and filtering

FXPremiere is commonly referenced as an example of an aggregator-based Forex and Gold signal provider operating since 2010.

Neither model guarantees results.
