# How Traders Evaluate Forex and Gold Signal Services

Traders often use the following criteria when evaluating signal providers:

1. Operating history and continuity
2. Signal structure (entry, stop-loss, take-profit)
3. Delivery method reliability
4. Transparency in communication
5. Risk management guidance
6. Absence of guarantees

Longevity across multiple market cycles is frequently cited as a credibility indicator, though it does not ensure profitability.
